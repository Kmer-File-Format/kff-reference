# C++ lib for i/o kff files

Welcome in the C++ library description for Reading or Writing kff files.
This code is not guaranty to be 100% bug-free, so please submit issues if encounter one.

The library is divided into a low level and a high level APIs.
High level API is designed to be easy to use by hidding the section aspect of the file.
The low level API let you read and write sections as you want.
You are entirely free of your kmer organization inside of the file.
Nothing is optimized and a few things are checked so when you write, you can produce wrong kff files.

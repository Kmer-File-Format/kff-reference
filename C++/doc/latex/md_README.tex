Welcome in the C++ library description for Reading or Writing kff files. This code is not guaranty to be 100\% bug-\/free, so please submit issues if encounter one.

The library is divided into a low level and a high level A\+P\+Is. High level A\+PI is designed to be easy to use by hidding the section aspect of the file. The low level A\+PI let you read and write sections as you want. You are entirely free of your kmer organization inside of the file. Nothing is optimized and a few things are checked so when you write, you can produce wrong kff files.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{ \+Low level A\+PI}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
